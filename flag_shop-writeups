# Write-up.

Use `cat store.c` to see the code.

```cpp
 if(number_flags > 0){
                    int total_cost = 0;
                    total_cost = 900*number_flags;
                    printf("\nThe final cost is: %d\n", total_cost);
                    if(total_cost <= account_balance){
                        account_balance = account_balance - total_cost;
                        printf("\nYour current balance after transaction: %d\n\n", account_balance);
                    }
                    else{
                        printf("Not enough funds to complete purchase\n");
                    }


                }
```

We can see that account_balance at first is 1100, which wouldn't be enough to buy 1337 flags (which costs 100000 dollars). ðŸ’¸

For such basic mathematics, 1100 - (-100.000.000) will be 1100 + 100.000.000.âž•

From this inference, they use integer total_cost to store value; the max value of int is around 2.1 billion, ~2.100.000.000. ðŸ”¢

If we enter a number of flags that exceeds what total_cost can contain, it will overflow and become a negative value. ðŸ“‰

We need to make it around 2.300.000.000, 2.3 billion / 900 is around 2555555. âž—

The flag is captured successfully. ðŸš©
